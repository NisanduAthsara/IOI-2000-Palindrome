# IOI-2000-Palindrome

<p>C++ solution for IOI Palindrome problem which was held in China in 2000.</p>
<h1>Intuition</h1>
<p>If we could find the excisting Longest Palindromic subsequence in the string it's easy to minimize number of insertions. So it's need to find the Longest Palindromic subsequence and substract it's from the original string length.</p>
